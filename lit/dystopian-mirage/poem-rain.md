## Rain


```
Science is the new magic of our age
Reveal remote secrets of dark unknown
Can quench thirst, solve world hunger
Babies and bombs can be homegrown

Take trip to other planets for weekends
Dig deeper into earth for shiny minerals
Cleaning ocean water for new bottles
Factories spewing froth rivers and worse

Deserts have been turned to gardens
Green forests have been left to sore
Draining all clouds with flying jets
In poor villages, doesn't rain anymore

Sorry, that's not all true though
Some villages it still rains often
No people left there to live it over
It's frothy clouds leftover by men
```
