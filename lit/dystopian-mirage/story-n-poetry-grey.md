## Grey

```
Every color died, died every heavenly scene.
Red, Blue, Green and all colors in between.
Lighter sky, darker lands, mountains a bit fray.
Oceans got layers of it, everything looks grey.

Farming to factories, factories to farm planets.
Butterflies to rain, foxes to dogs now robo pets.
Took hundreds years to turn, into dark times.
Some believe it's ash, some say just our eyes.

[WIP]
All I can see now are different variations of grey color.
It's like there is just one note left in the music of sight, with different flatter or shrilling pitches.
The roads are grey, buildings are grey, cloths are grey and so is my skin. Everywhere it's just varying shades of same color. I used to love monochrome, now that's just how the world is.
I remember the red blood, green moss, blue veins, brown clouds, maroon flowers and magenta ocean. I hear they were a lot prettier, but still we had some of it when I was a kid.
They say it all accelerated in recent years.
Our view of the world changed, mainly our ability to comprehend it's variety.
