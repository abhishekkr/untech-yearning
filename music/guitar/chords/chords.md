# Chords

* The name of the chord tells you what base (lowest) note.

Practice Tips
* more overarching finger shape on neck than flat out with tips vertically touching the strings not much above fret
* { form shape, strum chord, slightly move fingers around not leaving the strings, strum, shake off your hand } try again x-times
* try two string of chords first to get formation almost right (don't strum left out string); then move to complete once comfortable
