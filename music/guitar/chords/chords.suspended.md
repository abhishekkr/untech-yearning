## Playing Suspended Chords

While playing the D chord , try adding your pinkie finger to the chord at the third fret . This
new chord is often called " D - suspended " or " D - sus ." Then play D again . Now try lifting
your middle finger so that the top string of the chord is open . And back to D again .
You can do the same thing with the A - chord , but have to do the change on the second
string . Up one fret to the third makes A - sus , and you can also lift that finger to go down
a step on that second string . C - suspended requires you to go up a half step on the
fourth string . G - suspended requires you to do it on the fifth string . Learning suspended
chords is a guitar playing tip you ' ll find yourself using when you play contemporary songs .
