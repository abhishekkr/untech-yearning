## Circle of Fifths

* What's a Fifth?
It's fifth interval as
C - D - E - F - G
C -> G is a fifth
G -> D is a fifth
B -> F# (as no B#)

* Circle of Fifths

        C G D A E B F#/Gb Db Ab Eb Bb F
     .>-,-,-,-,-,-,---,---,--,--,--,--,-.

  The use of this is to identify key signatures and scales.

* What's scales and key signatures?

Scale is a collection of notes centered around a note, they are constructed using WHOLE STEPS (2 Frets) and HALF STEPS (1 Fret).
All major scales are constructed from a pattern of whole and half steps...
Key Signature is an abbreviated of describing a scale.

> C Major, Root C, all notes graviate towards it
> Key of C :  C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C
>               W   W   H   W   W   W   H
> W is for Whole Step, H for Half Step


> Pattern :  W   W   H   W   W   W   H


> D Major
> Key of D :  D - E - F#- G - A - B - C#- D
>               W   W   H   W   W   W   H
> W is for Whole Step, H for Half Step
> here F# and C# is Key Signature

* Using Circle

            flats <------>-|--> Sharps
       F#/Gb Db Ab Eb Bb F C G D A E B
     .---,---,--,--,--,--,-,-,-,-,-,-,--.
     |  6/6  5  4  3  2  1 0 1 2 3 4 5  |
     |__________________________________|


  Order of Sharps: F C G D A E B (from the circle)
  Order of Flats:  B E A D G C F (from circle, also opposite of sharps order)

>  So, A-Maj Scale has 3 sharps from F... so it goes like (need to match pattern)
>  A - B - C# - D - E - F# - G# - A

>  So, Ab-Maj Scale has 4 flats from B... so it goes like (need to match pattern)
>  Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - G - Ab

* Chords

> Primary Chords are to left and right, if you are in Key C, most used chords are C, G, D
> Secondary Chords most likely are 3 other after immediate left

> Chord Progression of Circle
> Most common movement for chords is by-fifth
> Cmi most common to goto G7
> G7 most common resolution is D
> Some say it moves before

> Chord Substitution
> If playing C Chord with melody note G, so if G is in Eb chord it can be used as substitute chord

> Tritone Intervals (Devil In Music) are directly accross
> like C-F#, A-Eb, B-F
