# Harmonics

They are mostly harmonics 5,7,12 frets away from every note.

2nd Fret Pentatonic, harmonics are 12 Fret high.
Pcking at that distance, or tapping shall get in the effect.

### Artificial Harmonics

> (wiki)
> Holds a note and lightly touch a point on the string that is an integer divisor of its vibrational length, and plucks or bows the side of the string that is closer to the bridge.
> This technique is used to produce harmonic tones that are otherwise inaccessible on the instrument

#### Pinched Harmonics (false harmonics/squeal)
(Artist Reference: Billy Gibbons, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai)

> (wiki)
> Thumb or index finger on the picking hand slightly catches the string after picked, canceling the fundamental frequency of string, and letting one of harmonics dominate.

> * hold down the note
> * (acoustic) with your thumb place knuckle on the string, pluck fast with finger and quickly remove thumb
> * (electric) set bridge pickup, choke up your pick, flick while light brushing your thumb in process
> * try putting a vinrato

### Harmonic Overtones

```practice
make Fret-Hand loop over
i.E2 fret2 fixed
x.E2 fret4 hammer-on >> x.E2 fret4 pull-off
m.E2 fret3 hammer-on >> m.E2 fret3 pull-off

Pick-Hand palm-side sliding upwards (downwards) from sound-hole on frets very smoothly.
```
