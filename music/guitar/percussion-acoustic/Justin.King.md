> How to Slap, Tap and Pop on Acoustic Guitar with Justin King

tips:

* for slap and pull keep right hand roughly in one shape, plucker horizontal to slap and index finger curled to pull to gain speed

* when left for melody and right for rhythm; big top for bass drum, finger roll near side, then pinky on side for snare

* flamenco-ish triplet `{index,middle} down, plucker down, plucker up`, more of wrist motion than just fingers
