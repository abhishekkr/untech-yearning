# Rhythm Pattern


### Gallop

Pattern: Down Down Up Down
Might alternate it with a chord.

---

### Thrash Rhythm
(Artists like Motorhead, early Metallica)

There is a thrash speed picking. Just pick low string repeatedly.
Like Gallop can also alternate with Chords.

---

* Can keep throwing in single notes in between with these.

* Rests are required at correct places for musical structure. Artists like AC/DC, Black Sabbath, Metallica have great examples. Use Palm block for quick, volume zero for transitional.
