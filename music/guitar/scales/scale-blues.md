# Pentatonic Scale

Not actually solo scale for Blues Music, this scale is mostly the concept of capturing blues flavor.
Mostly talked about Minor Pentatonic with a Flat Fifth Added. Add an extra note between 4th and the 5th.
Then adding a little vibrato and slide-bend at right moment will bring more blues-y feel.
