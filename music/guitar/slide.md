### Slide

> Different Types
>  * Bottle,Glass
>  * Steel
>  * Brass/Copper
> Smaller are better, doesn't restrict normal guitar playing hand shapes.

* Start by keeping slide angle parallel to frets
* Slide's replacing Fret, need to be placed right above the fret-bar and not behind it
* Slides shouldn't press down much on frets but sit on string
* fingerstyle is better than pick, it will be doing muting with free finger and thumb side for muted-notes
* use slide on a or m, make i mute upper notes by laying up on string
* trying it with regular tuning is fine
* going to more blues, try Open-G or Open-E tuning
* for Vibrato effect, sliding either side of the note not up|down
* trying G-Major scale (or basically any) and paying attention being in-tune
