## Guitar Techniques to Practice

* HammerOns
* PullOffs/FlickOffs
* Finger Dexterity: Rolling
* Vibrato (Hand, Classical, Circular)
* Bending
* Stretching
* Tremolo

---

##### Finger Dexterity: Rolling

> For decresing String number
>  * press X+1 string
>  * lay back flat (rollover) on X string
>
> For incresing String number
>  * lay back flat on X-1 string
>  * press (rollover) on X string

##### Vibrato

> Hand (Vertical/Blues/Rock) Vibrato
>  * Thumb over top
>  * a on main-fret-string, i and m on above two frets of it OR just m on main-fret-string with i above OR just i on main-fret-string
>  * Play, Pull Down (or Push up based on string and shape), Relax, Play...(loop) <can try the slide up down in wider range for different effect>
>  * try the slow slides and fast for different effects as well

> Classical Vibrato
>  * just main finger would be on fretboard shaking the string with rolling finger high-low
>  * all other fingers and thumb would be up in air moving to give the main finger motion
>  * try slow and fast motion, also comobo of fast->slow and slow->fast motion

> Circular (Whole Arm) Vibrato
>  * just main finger would be on fretboard rolling the string up-around
>  * all other fingers and thumb would be up in air moving to give the main finger wilder motion to try keep it going
>  * the picking hand might rest on other string around muting them off

* try with all fingers
* _Practice moving from a Bend direct to Vibrato_
* _Observe BBKing, Steve Vai, Clapton and other's style and try experiment their licks_

> *specials* BBKing's Wrist Vibrato
>  * almost Circular Vibrato except for not much rolling string up and down
>  * also really fast wrist shake

##### Classical Tremolo

* first practice i,m,a lined up (in staright line) on same string playing it
* then i,m,a lined up on same string playing it, with follow-up p on same string
* then i,m,a lined up on same string playing it, with follow-up p on all above strings
* can try placing p along with last on i,m,a to pick up on speed
* can plant all i,m,a if too fast (immediately one after other) or different strings
* practice finger-picking patterns p.S1-a.S1-m.S2-i.S3 and a.S1-m.S2-i.S3-p.S3
* practice translation between 8notes to 16notes for both patterns
* vary from 60bpm to 120bpm
* once perfected, practice all with chords

---

#### Also,

* fartlek(speed play) subdivisions(way we divide our beat): at 70/min try divide beat into 1(4notes),2(8notes)...,3(12notes),4(16notes)...,5,6; TRY transition between subdivisions

> For Finger strength and shape, on any Scale, in even tempo, SLOW
> first 2 finger combo
>  * HammerOns by all fingers (in i->m, m->a, a->x, i->x co-ordination)
>  * PullOffs by all fingers (in m->i, a->m, x->a, x->i co-ordination)
> then 3 finger combo
>  * HammerOns by all fingers (in i->m->a, m->a->x, i->a->x, i->m->x co-ordination)
>  * PullOffs by all fingers (in a->m->i, x->a->m, x->a->i, x->m->i co-ordination)
