#### Natural Harmonics

* (delicate) touch string directly above metal fret at particular places on neck
> 12th 7th and 5th fret

#### Artificial Pinch Harmonics

* like placing finger directly above 12th fret and plucking it below with thumb or pinky for open string is natural pinch harmonic

* similarly, fretting X and then pinching X+12 fret for harmonics gets Artificial Pinch harmonic
> can practice on chord shapes shuffling between strings
