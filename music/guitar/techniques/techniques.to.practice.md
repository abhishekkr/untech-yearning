## Guitar Techniques to Practice

* HammerOns
* PullOffs/FlickOffs
* Finger Dexterity: Rolling
* Vibrato (Hand, Classical, Circular)
* Bending
* Stretching
* Tremolo
* Snap Picking

---

##### Finger Dexterity: Rolling

> For decresing String number
>  * press X+1 string
>  * lay back flat (rollover) on X string
>
> For incresing String number
>  * lay back flat on X-1 string
>  * press (rollover) on X string

---

##### Bending

> 1,2,3 string bend up; 4,5,6 bend down
 
> Try Bending with Releasing followed by Pull-off
> Two-Fret Bend on a Pentatonic
> One-Fret Bend, quite similar to vibrato

* Overbend (Artist example: Jimmy Page, Van Halen, Dave Gilmour)

---

##### Classical Tremolo

* first practice i,m,a lined up (in staright line) on same string playing it
* then i,m,a lined up on same string playing it, with follow-up p on same string
* then i,m,a lined up on same string playing it, with follow-up p on all above strings
* can try placing p along with last on i,m,a to pick up on speed
* can plant all i,m,a if too fast (immediately one after other) or different strings
* practice finger-picking patterns p.S1-a.S1-m.S2-i.S3 and a.S1-m.S2-i.S3-p.S3
* practice translation between 8notes to 16notes for both patterns
* vary from 60bpm to 120bpm
* once perfected, practice all with chords

---

##### Snap Picking

* Holding pick around 45degree to strings (not flatpicking).
* Just twitching thumb and index finger up andd down.
* Trying to do this quickly on fewer strings based licks to pick up speed.
* No wrist or hand movement involved.

---

#### Also,

* fartlek(speed play) subdivisions(way we divide our beat): at 70/min try divide beat into 1(4notes),2(8notes)...,3(12notes),4(16notes)...,5,6; TRY transition between subdivisions

> For Finger strength and shape, on any Scale, in even tempo, SLOW
> first 2 finger combo
>  * HammerOns by all fingers (in i->m, m->a, a->x, i->x co-ordination)
>  * PullOffs by all fingers (in m->i, a->m, x->a, x->i co-ordination)
> then 3 finger combo
>  * HammerOns by all fingers (in i->m->a, m->a->x, i->a->x, i->m->x co-ordination)
>  * PullOffs by all fingers (in a->m->i, x->a->m, x->a->i, x->m->i co-ordination)
