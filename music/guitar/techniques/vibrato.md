## Vibrato

#### Hand (Vertical/Blues/Rock/Rocker) Vibrato
>  * Thumb over top
>  * a on main-fret-string, i and m on above two frets of it OR just m on main-fret-string with i above OR just i on main-fret-string
>  * Play, Pull Down (or Push up based on string and shape), Relax, Play...(loop) <can try the slide up down in wider range for different effect>
>  * try the slow slides and fast for different effects as well

> bend lateral to above and lower pitch, in classical popular on base notes

#### Classical Vibrato
>  * just main finger would be on fretboard shaking the string with rolling finger high-low
>  * all other fingers and thumb would be up in air moving to give the main finger motion
>  * try slow and fast motion, also comobo of fast->slow and slow->fast motion

Sub-types in classical vibrato:
* Radius/Ulna
> the simple rock back-n-forth on fret on finger tip, sideways for tip
* Push-Pull
> press down hard, then while doing "radius/ulna" gives pull effect

#### Circular (Whole Arm) Vibrato
>  * just main finger would be on fretboard rolling the string up-around
>  * all other fingers and thumb would be up in air moving to give the main finger wilder motion to try keep it going
>  * the picking hand might rest on other string around muting them off

#### Behind the Nut

> on open notes, behind the nut pressing hard down on it gives this impact to higher pitch

---

#### Neck Bend

> pitch down by pressing top towards yourself, neck away from
> or reverse for pitch up
