### Tuning

Carry a tuner. Physical battery-powered tuners are best.

Can get phone apps for ease and availability.
Two of my common phone apps used for tuning are `smartChord` and `Strings Tuner`.
`Strings Tuner` is a heavy adware but allows support for multiple strings instrument like Ukulele, Banjo and more alongwith Guitar.

Can tune by ear.
At least get yourself fixed on one note, tune the 6th using that.
Then 5th fret on 6th string shall be same as open 5th string.
5th fret on 5th string shall be same as open 4th string.
Then 4th fret on 5th string shall be same as open 3rd string.
Then 3rd fret on 4th string shall be same as open 2nd string.
Then 2nd fret on 5th string shall be same as open 1st string.
