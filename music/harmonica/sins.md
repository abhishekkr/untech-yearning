## What not to do?

* faulty amisher
> don't press hard against your lips
> to play high notes, make smaller hole with lips and blow air faster

* not keeping the beat
> doesn't matter what

* bending
> can yank down, whale at hole 1,2,4,5,6 'cuz you get blues pitch
> not hole 3, this need to be subtle
