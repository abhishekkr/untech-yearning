### Pursing or Puckering?

not to narrow the lips a lot but pucker from inner part of lips and outer part bigger around harmonica

enables to play one note a time

---

### Tongue Blocking?

as opposed to Puckering, for big notes

while blowing notes, blocking with tongue

works good with rhythmic vamping (loop-y harmony)

---

### Bending?

mainly associated with blues harmonica

shaping mouth or placing tongue to change note to a lower pitch

play a single note

> while drawing, try pulling back the tongue to top then letting it back

> can do while blowing as well

---

### Wailing?

draw a note aggresively, could be with glissando(slide)

---

### Warbling?

the quick shake, between two notes

> like 3-4 draw, 4-5 blow, 4-5 draw

---

### Vibrato?

> Vibrato varies pitch, cyclically going higher nad lower creating a rhythm.
> Tremolo will use modulation of volume instead of pitch for similar rhythm. Quivering tongue to block note and release for tremolo.

different modes of getting a vibrato

* from the throat, with one whole breath

* from the lungs/belly

* from the mouth/jaw (really good on high notes, mainly on blow notes)

* shaking the harmonica

### Tongueing?

for sounding like quarter notes

* `double tongueing` for couplets, is sweeping tongue forward and backward on mouth top

* `triple tounging` for triplets, sweeping front-back-front

---
