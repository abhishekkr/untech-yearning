## Raag

* source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org), [ITC Sangeet Research Academy](http://www.itcsra.org/alankar/alankar.html)

Literal meaning is Color. Raag is to music what color is to visual art.

> Ragas with 4 swaras are 'Suratara', with 5 'Audava', with 6 'Shaadava' and with 7 as 'Sampoorna'.
> Vakra Ragas (crooked) are which don't follow strict ascending/descending of Swaras.
> Mood of Raga and their rendering is more important than the notes used. Ragas can share exact same notes but sound different.

> Some alankar (ornamentations) of Raga
> * Meend/Glide : similar to Glissando in western music, glide to play next swara
> * Andolan : oscillation of pitch of a note, back-forth, slower than Gamak and the supporting tone is always higher
> * Murki : NiSaNiSaNi and slide (Dhaa Na); played like combination of Meend than on frets
> * Gamak : fast Andolan, heavy trill, composite of few Meend, supporting notes can be higher or lower, slower than kampan
> * Kan : Each note as link to preceding/succeeding notes. These linking notes are Grace Notes or Kan Swaras.
> * Sparsha Svara : is like Hammer-On of western style, which is used for ascending notes without plucking
> * Krintan : is like Pull-Off from western style, which is descending notes without right hand plucking
> * Kampan/Kampit : is like Vibrato in western music, supporting note is higher than true
> * Khatka/Gitkari : cluster of notes played very fast with gusto decorate another note
> * Zamzama : rendered in progressive combinations and permutations, sounds like complex tan pattern with sharp gamkas
