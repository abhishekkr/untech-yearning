## Alankar

Alankar are different decroations over normal note playing.
They give a different range and sometime vocal feel to the musical note.
Bharata's Natyashastra (treatise on dramaturgy) written sometime between 200BC and 200 AD mentions 33 types of Alankars.
Sharangdeva's *Sangeet Ratnakar* (musical treatise) in 13th century and Ahobal's *Sangeet Parijat* 17th century mentions *63 and 68* types of alankars.

Two broad groups
* Varnalankar
> Four varnas (Sthayi, Arohi, Avarohi, Sanchari) were arrangements of notes in a particular sequence of four kinds of movements among notes.
> Sthayi is halting at a single note.
> Arohi to an upward movement
> Avarohi to a downward movement
> Sanchari is mixed upward and downward movement

* Shabdalankar
> Refers to sound production techniques utilised.
> It has a wide connotation and would actually include every melodic and rhythmic quality brought around fixed composition/bandish.

Besides raag, tala and bandish which are fixed protions in a performance, the process of elaboration has been divided into several 'angas' or stages. These comprising 'anga' are 'alaap-vistaar', 'behelawa', 'bol-bant', 'sargams', 'taans'; in 'vilambit laya' and 'drut laya' in case of 'khayal' and 'alaap'; 'jod' and 'gats' in case of instrumental music.
These may differ from gharana to another. Thus when talked of alankar, specifically refer to embellishments to a swar.

The grace notes or 'alankarik swars' are the foundation of all alankars. The shrutis or microtones in raag sangeet utilize this nature.
When a cluster of notes embellish another swar, they become 'alankarik pad'.

Many alankars behavior is raag and form-specific, so their wrong or less-more usage will harm the rendition.
