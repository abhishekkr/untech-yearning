Gm                         D#
Have you got color in your cheeks?

Cm                                          Gm
Do you ever get that feelin' that you can't shift the tide
That sticks around like summat's in your teeth
                D#               Cm
Ah, there's some aces up your sleeve
                                Gm
Have you no idea that you're in deep
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
         D#              Cm
How many secrets can you keep?
             Gm
'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow
When I play it on repeat
   D#       Cm
Until I fall asleep
                      D
Spilling drinks on my settee

D#
(Do I wanna know?)
Cm
If this feeling flows both ways
Gm
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
D#                Cm              Gm
That the nights were mainly made for saying
Things that you can't say tomorrow day

Gm
Crawlin' back to you
                              Cm
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
Gm
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Cm
Now I've thought it through

Gm
Crawling back to you

```
