Verse:

Am  C      D      Am      C      D       Am
I hurt myself today to see if I still feel
  C     D      Am        C    D           Am
I focus on the pain the only thing thats real
    C      D       Am        C     D      Am
The needle tears a hole the old familiar sting
       C       D    Am           C      D    G
Try to kill it all away but I remember everything

Chorus:

Am            F    C            G
What Have I become my sweetest friend
Am         F           C          G
Everyone I know goes away in the end
    Am                F    C            G
And you could have it all my empire of dirt
Am             F     G               Am
I will let you down I will make you hurt

Verse:

Am C         D        Am       C      D     Am
I wear this crown of thorns upon my liars chair
C       D      Am        C    D     Am
Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair
  C         D         Am        C       D      Am
Beneath the stains of time the feeling disappears
C       D       Am    C    D           G
You are someone else I am still right here

Chorus:

Am            F    C             G
What Have I become my sweetest friend
Am         F           C          G
Everyone I know goes away in the end
    Am                F    C            G
And you could have it all my empire of dirt
Am             F     C               G
I will let you down I will make you hurt

Outro:
   C       D      Am      C       D      Am
If I could start again a million miles away
C       D      Am    C       D      Am(hold)
I would keep myself I would find a way
