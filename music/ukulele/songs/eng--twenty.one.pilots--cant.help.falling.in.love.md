[Verse 1]
C    Em  Am   ~   F     C    G  ~
Wise men say Only fools rush in
   F  G     Am    F    ~    C    G    C  
But I can't help falling in love with you


C    Em  Am       F     C    G
Shall I stay? Would it be a sin?
   F  G     Am    F         C    G    C  
If I can't help falling in love with you

[Chorus]
Em     B7
Like a river flows
Em     B7
Surely to the sea
Em     B7
Darling, so it goes
A7                       Dm    G                 {F can replace Dm, G7 replace G for different effect}
Some things are meant to be....eee

Take my hand Take my whole life too
   F  G     Am    F         C    G    C  
For I can't help falling in love with you

[Chorus]
Em     B7
Like a river flows
Em     B7
Surely to the sea
Em     B7
Darling, so it goes
A7     ~                 Dm    G
Some things are meant to be....ee

[Verse 3]

Take my hand Take my whole life, too

For I can't help falling in love with you

For I can't help falling in love with you
